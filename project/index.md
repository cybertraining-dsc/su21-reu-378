**Keywords:** Autism, Facial Analysis. 

## 1. Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad range of lifelong developmental and neurological disorders that usually appear during early childhood. Autism Spectrum Disorder can cause challenges with speech and nonverbal communication, repetitive behaviors, and social skills.

- [ ] Briefly explain the topic of my report (Detection of autism in children using a facial image).
- [ ] State how AI will be applied/used. (Talk about AI and Autism)

## 2. Using Images

- [ ] Iniclude images in report. If copied, cite them.

## 3. Using itemized lists only where needed

Remember this is not a powerpoint presentation, but a report so we recommend

1. Use itemized or enumeration lists sparingly
2. When using bulleted lists use * and not - 

## 4. Datasets

- [ ] Querying the dataset autism prevalence studies summary with an area of three cities @data.world
- [ ] Find a similar dataset in kaggle.com

## 5. Benchmark

- [ ] Include a benchmark. (The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2])
 
## 6. Conclusion

- [ ] Conclude my project.

## 7. Acknowledgments

- [ ] Add acknowledgments.

## 8. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before the first square bracket.
