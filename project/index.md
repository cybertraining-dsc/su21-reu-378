## 1. Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad range of lifelong developmental and neurological disorders, that usually appear during early childhood. Autism affects the brain and can cause challenges with speech and nonverbal communication, repetitive behaviors, and social skills. Autism Spectrum Disorder can occur in all socioeconomic, ethnic, and racial groups. This neurological disorder can usually be detected and diagnosed from the age of three years old, and up. As of June 2021, the World Health Organization has estimated that one in 160 children have an Autism Spectrum Disorder worldwide. Moreover, in 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that one in 54 children in the United States have been diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Autism is notably more common among boys than it is among girls.

## 2. Using Images

- [ ] Iniclude images in report. If copied, cite them.

## 3. Datasets

- [ ] Querying the dataset autism prevalence studies summary with an area of three cities @data.world
- [ ] Find a similar dataset in kaggle.com

## 4. Benchmark

- [ ] Include a benchmark. (The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2])
 
## 5. Conclusion

- [ ] Conclude my project.

## 6. Acknowledgments

- [ ] Add acknowledgments.

## 7. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before the first square bracket.
