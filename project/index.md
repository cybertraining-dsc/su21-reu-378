**Keywords:** Autism, Facial Analysis. 

## 1. Introduction

- [ ] Add General Introduction about Autism.
- [ ] Briefly explain the topic of my report (Detection of autism in children using a facial image).
- [ ] State how AI will be applied/used.

## 2. Using Images

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 3. Using itemized lists only where needed

Remember this is not a powerpoint presentation, but a report so we recommend

1. Use itemized or enumeration lists sparingly
2. When using bulleted lists use * and not - 

## 4. Datasets

- [ ] Querying the dataset autism prevalence studies summary with an area of three cities @data.world
- [ ] Find a similar dataset in kaggle.com

## 5. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 7. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 8. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
